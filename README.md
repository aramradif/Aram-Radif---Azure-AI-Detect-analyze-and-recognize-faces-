Provision an Azure AI Face API resource
If you don’t already have one in your subscription, you’ll need to provision an Azure AI Face API resource.

Note: In this exercise, you’ll use a standalone Face resource. You can also use Azure AI Face services in an Azure AI Services multi-service resource, either directly or in an Azure AI Foundry project.

Open the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com, and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any welcome messages or tips that are displayed.
Select Create a resource.
In the search bar, search for Face, select Face, and create the resource with the following settings:
Subscription: Your Azure subscription
Resource group: Create or select a resource group
Region: Choose any available region
Name: A valid name for your Face resource
Pricing tier: Free F0
Create the resource and wait for deployment to complete, and then view the deployment details.
When the resource has been deployed, go to it and under the Resource management node in the navigation pane, view its Keys and Endpoint page. You will need the endpoint and one of the keys from this page in the next procedure.
